## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=TRUE}
taxi<-read.csv("full_data.csv")
set.seed(42)
summary(taxi)
p=cbind(taxi$pickup_longitude,taxi$pickup_latitude)
logic=p[,1]>-74.02 & p[,1]< -73.77 & p[,2]>40.63 & p[,2]<40.84
pickup.location=p[logic,]

pickup.1<-kmeans(pickup.location,nstart = 20,centers = 4)
plot(pickup.location,col=pickup.1$cluster+1,xlim = c(-74.02,-73.77),ylim = c(40.63,40.84))

pickup.hc<-hclust(dist(pickup.location),method = "single") 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
